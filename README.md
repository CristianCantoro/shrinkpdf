# shrinkpdf
A simple bash script to shrink (reduce the size of) a PDF file.

I found this script somewhere on the web and I am unable to retrieve the
original author, it may be
[Alfred Klomp](http://www.alfredklomp.com/programming/shrinkpdf/).
Several people have this script in their utilities collections here on Github,
too.

For this reason I assume it is safe to put this script in the Public Domain.

The usage is very simple:
```
usage: shrinkpdf <filename> <resolution> [<output>]
```

for example:
```
shrinkpdf input.pdf 72dpi output.pdf
```

This script is useful anytime you have to send a PDF online and/or for
mail-to-fax services that usually have some sort of limit on file sizes.

If you want to contribute fork and pull right away.
