# shrinkpdf
A simple bash script to shrink (reduce the size) a PDF file.

I found this script somewhere on the web and I am unable to retrieve the
original author.
Some people have this script in their utilities collections here on Github, too.

The usage is very simple:
```
usage: shrinkpdf <filename> <resolution> [<output>]
```

This script is useful anytime you have to send a PDF online and/or for
mail-to-fax services that usually have some sort of limit on file sizes.

If you want to contribute fork and pull right away.
